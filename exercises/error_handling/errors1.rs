// you pass it an empty string. It'd be nicer if it explained what the problem
// was, instead of just sometimes returning `None`. Thankfully, Rust has a similar
// construct to `Option` that can be used to express error conditions. Let's use it!
// Execute `rustlings hint errors1` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a hint.

        //a part of Result type. So, first we defined return type as Result<String, String>. Because either Ok or
